## Installation Instructions

To copy from GitHub and build a Unity project without installing additional files, follow these general steps:

### Clone the Repository:

Open the GitHub repository page containing the Unity project.
Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" if you don't have Git installed, or use Git to clone the repository if you have it installed.
If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents to a dedicated folder on your computer.
### Open Unity Hub:

Ensure you have Unity Hub installed on your machine. Unity Hub is a management tool for Unity projects.
Open Unity Hub and click on the "Add" button to add a new project.
### Select the Project:

Navigate to the folder where you extracted or cloned the Unity project.
Select the project folder and click "Open" or "Select Folder."
Install Unity Version (if needed):

If the Unity project requires a specific Unity version that you don't have installed, Unity Hub will prompt you to download and install the required version. Follow the prompts to install it.
### Open the Project:

Once the Unity version is installed, click on the project thumbnail in Unity Hub to open the project.
Resolve Dependencies (if needed):

Unity projects may have dependencies or plugins. Check the project documentation or readme for any specific instructions on resolving dependencies. You might need to import certain assets or packages from the Unity Asset Store.
### Build the Project:

Once the project is open, go to "File" -> "Build Settings."
Choose the target platform for your build (e.g., PC, Mac, Android, iOS).
Click on "Switch Platform" if necessary.
Click on "Build" to generate the executable or project files.
### Run the Project:

After building, you can run the project by executing the generated executable or running it directly from the Unity Editor.
These steps should allow you to copy a Unity project from GitHub, set it up in Unity Hub, and build it without needing to install additional files beyond Unity Hub and the required Unity version. Note that specific projects may have unique requirements, so always check the project documentation for any additional instructions.
